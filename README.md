**Some notes**
- Changed forum page to 'Job Posting' page
- Upon accepting a job listing, a 'make an offer' popup would appear. An organization can negotiate with the client using this feature.
    <p align = "center">

    </p>
- Accepted job listing would appear on **One-To-One Transactions** section in both client and org's 'My Transactions' page.
