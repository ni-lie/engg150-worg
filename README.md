## Forum
- **For the most part, the forum page is now functional**.

    </p>
-  Users, clients, and organizations can add a forum post where they can specify the following fields:
   -  Service name
   -  Description of service
   -  Category
   -  A Photo (to help describe the service they need)
    <p align = "center"> 
        <img src="images\AddForum.png" alt="image">
    </p>
- Other users can also comment on a post
    <p align = "center"> 
        <img src="images\comment.png" alt="image">
    </p>

**Some notes**
- There may be some bugs that need to be fixed (please lmk if you happen to see one)
- Threads are not possible to implement using *Bubble.io* (or at least it's quite a task and impractical to implement) 
- Nice to have feature: Add something below the *Add a forum post* button so it won't look empty or vacant
- UI **may need** some fixing XD
