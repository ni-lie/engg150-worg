## Forum
Product backlog:
1. PB #5 (For Organizations): As an organization, I should be able to peruse job postings from different industries. 
2. PB #3 (For Industries): From an industry, I am able to post services that I need. 
- **For the most part, the forum page is now functional**.

-  Users, clients, and organizations can add a forum post where they can specify the following fields:
   -  Service name
   -  Description of service
   -  Category
   -  A Photo (to help describe the service they need)

**Some notes**
- There may be some bugs that need to be fixed (please lmk if you happen to see one)
- Threads are not possible to implement using *Bubble.io* (or at least it's quite a task and impractical to implement) 
- Nice to have feature: Add something below the *Add a forum post* button so it won't look empty or vacant
- UI **may need** some fixing XD
