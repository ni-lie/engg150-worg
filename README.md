1. (I.2) From an industry, I am able to post services that I need  
    1.1 (I.2.1) Create a page wherein all industry partner's job postings can be found (Similar to Services)   
        <p align = "center"> 
            <img src="images\job_posting_page.png" alt="image">
        </p>
    1.2 (I.2.2) There is a button in 'My Transactions' for Client Accounts that appears 'Create Job Opportunity' that sends a Client to the 'Create Job Opportunity Page'  
        <p align = "center"> 
            <img src="images\job_button_on_transactions.png" alt="image">
        </p>
    1.3 (I.2.3) Create a Job Opportunity Page - Similar to 'Offer your service page' but modified for this context   
        <p align = "center"> 
            <img src="images\create_job_posting.png" alt="image">
        </p>
    1.4 (I.2.4) Once job is created it should appear on industry partner's job postings page   
        - You may try creating a new job listing and it should appear on industry partner's job postings page

**Some notes**
- Changed forum page to 'Job Posting' page
- "Accept Job" is not yet working
